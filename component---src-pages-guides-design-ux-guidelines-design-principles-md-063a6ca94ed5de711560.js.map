They will be your roadmap, ensuring that what you create is not only visually appealing but also consistent, accessible, and user-friendly. Think of them as your toolkit for building something that looks great, works well, and fits seamlessly into the application.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"consistency-creating-a-cohesive-experience\"\n    }}>{`Consistency: creating a cohesive experience`}</h2>\n    <p>{`You should design your add-ons to feel like a natural extension of the platform, conforming to Adobe Express's visual language: the Spectrum Design System. This coherence isn't just about visual elements but extends to interaction patterns and behaviours. Keeping everything aligned creates a smoother experience where users can easily navigate and understand your add-on, achieving their goals effortlessly.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"accessibility-designing-for-inclusion\"\n    }}>{`Accessibility: designing for inclusion`}</h2>\n    <p>{`All add-ons you develop should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or circumstances. This includes considering elements like contrast and text size, as well as accommodating a broad spectrum of digital skills. An accessible design adapts to the user, offering clear and intuitive interactions, removing barriers, and making sure that every user can fully engage with it.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"usability-prioritizing-ease-of-use\"\n    }}>{`Usability: prioritizing ease of use`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Your add-on should be as easy to operate as it is powerful. Design it with users in mind so they can navigate it effortlessly, where each feature is clearly accessible and straightforward. Eliminate unnecessary steps and ensure that every interaction feels natural. Always provide feedback so users know what to expect and how to achieve their goals. The more intuitive the experience, the more likely they are to engage and rely on it over again.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"aesthetics-balancing-form-and-function\"\n    }}>{`Aesthetics: balancing form and function`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The aesthetic appeal of your add-on plays a significant role in the overall user experience: a pleasing design attracts more users and enhances their interaction with it. When the design is functional and visually charming, it creates an enjoyable experience and complements usability. Keeping the aesthetics aligned with Adobe's brand identity will reinforce the connection to the platform and tighten the overall user experience.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"bringing-it-all-together\"\n    }}>{`Bringing it all together`}</h2>\n    <p>{`By embracing these design principles, you'll build add-ons that integrate smoothly with Adobe Express and provide real value to users. Each concept works in harmony with the others; keep these guidelines in mind as you develop, and you'll create tools that are both effective and a pleasure to use. In the following pages, you'll find detailed recommendations, requirements, and best practices to help you apply these principles to your projects.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","_ref","components","props","_objectWithoutProperties","_excluded","mdx","_extends","mdxType","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
