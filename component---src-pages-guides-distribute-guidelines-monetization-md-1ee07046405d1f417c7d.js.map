This payment could be a one-time fee or subscription.\n     Freemium add-ons have a high percentage of acquisition in our marketplace, making this our recommended option.\n     ### Paid\n     This requires users to pay a fee before using the add-on. You may wish to offer a trial period at the outset, in which users can test out the add-on for a certain period of time before deciding whether to pay.\n     ### Sign-up for service (SaaS)\n     The add-on requires the user to have access to external services before they can use it.\n     ### Credits\n     This model asks users to buy credits which can be used for services on the add-on. This can be used for things such as licensing images or trying out Generative AI models. Many add-ons offer users some free credits to start so they can test out the service. */}\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"our-monetization-guidelines\"\n    }}>{`Our Monetization Guidelines`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We’ve created these standards to ensure that monetized add-ons provide users with a consistent and reliable experience.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"transparency\"\n    }}>{`Transparency`}</h3>\n    <p>{`All add-on developers must be transparent about their pricing and monetization methods.
