Only update UI, analyze data, or communicate with your panel."},{"question":"How do I clear the selection?","answer":"Set `editor.context.selection = []` or `editor.context.selection = undefined` to clear all selections."},{"question":"What selection rules should I know?","answer":"Only nodes within the current artboard can be selected, you cannot select both parent and child nodes simultaneously, and locked nodes are automatically filtered from the main selection."},{"question":"How do I clean up selection event handlers?","answer":"Always call `editor.context.off(EditorEvent.selectionChange, handlerId)` using the ID returned from `on()` to prevent memory leaks."},{"question":"How do I communicate selection changes to my UI?","answer":"Use the runtime API to send selection data from the document sandbox to your UI panel, enabling real-time interface updates."},{"question":"What are common selection-based actions?","answer":"Typical actions include updating properties panels, enabling/disabling tools, applying formatting to selected text, grouping elements, and showing context-appropriate options."}]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1440646406","1814815295","3508090095"]}
