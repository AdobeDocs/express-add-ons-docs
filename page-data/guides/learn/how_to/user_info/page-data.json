However, for anonymous users, the ID is temporary and will change if they later log in."},{"question":"Are these methods synchronous?","answer":"No, `userId()`, `isPremiumUser()`, and `isAnonymousUser()` are all asynchronous methods that return promises."},{"question":"What can I use the user ID for?","answer":"Track user subscriptions, manage user-specific features, and integrate with licensing services."},{"question":"How can I use premium status information?","answer":"Tailor user experience, unlock premium features, or suggest Adobe Express premium functionality."},{"question":"Is the user ID personally identifiable?","answer":"No, the user ID is anonymized and cannot be used to identify users personally."},{"question":"What limitations do anonymous users have?","answer":"Anonymous users cannot export final content (only preview renditions), have temporary user IDs that don't persist beyond 24 hours, and their settings won't persist across sessions."},{"question":"How should I handle data persistence for anonymous users?","answer":"Use local storage for temporary settings and prompt users to log in for persistent features. Anonymous user data should be treated as ephemeral."},{"question":"Can anonymous users use all add-on features?","answer":"Anonymous users can use most features but cannot export final content. Always check `isAnonymousUser()` before showing export options and provide a 'Sign in to export' message."}]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1440646406","1814815295","3508090095"]}
