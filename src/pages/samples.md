# Code Samples

Find inspiration and great reference examples by checking out our [code samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/express-add-on-samples) repo. A description of each sample and which features and technologies they use is available here for reference.

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="info"/>

In addition to these code samples, you should also be sure to check out the [Templates section](guides/getting_started/dev_tooling.md#templates) in the **Development Tools** page for the options available for creating a starter project based on your favorite development stack.

## Using the samples

- Clone [the repo](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/express-add-on-samples) (or download the zip).
- `cd` into the folder of a sample you want to try.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm run build` to build the source.
- Run `npm run start` to start to start the server with your bundled sample
- Navigate to Adobe Express and load and use the locally running sample add-on with the add-on panel developer tools just as you would with your own.

**NOTE:** Before you run any samples, you must have previously run the `npx @adobe/create-ccweb-add-on` command to create your own add-on at least once to ensure the package is available and ready to use.
