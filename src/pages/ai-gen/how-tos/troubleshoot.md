## Installation Issues

### Problem: Add-on Fails to Install
- **Solution:** Ensure that you have the correct permissions and that your environment meets the add-on's requirements. Check the installation logs for specific error messages.

### Problem: Dependencies Not Found
- **Solution:** Verify that all required dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file and that they are correctly installed. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install missing dependencies.

## Configuration Problems

### Problem: Incorrect Configuration Settings
- **Solution:** Double-check your configuration files for typos or incorrect values. Refer to the documentation for the correct configuration settings.

### Problem: Environment Variables Not Set
- **Solution:** Ensure that all required environment variables are set. You can use a `.env` file to manage environment variables.

## Debugging Tips

### Problem: Unable to Debug Add-On
- **Solution:** Use browser developer tools to inspect and debug your add-on. Set breakpoints and use the console to log messages and inspect variables.

### Problem: Debugger Not Hitting Breakpoints
- **Solution:** Ensure that your source maps are correctly configured and that the code you are debugging matches the deployed code.

## Performance Issues

### Problem: Slow Performance
- **Solution:** Optimize your code by reducing the complexity of algorithms, minimizing DOM manipulations, and using efficient data structures. Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

### Problem: High Memory Usage
- **Solution:** Identify and fix memory leaks by using browser developer tools to monitor memory usage and track down the source of leaks.

## API Errors

### Problem: API Requests Failing
- **Solution:** Check the API endpoint and ensure that it is correct. Verify that your API keys and authentication tokens are valid and have the necessary permissions.

### Problem: Unexpected API Responses
- **Solution:** Validate the data being sent to and received from the API. Ensure that your request payloads and response handling code are correctly implemented.

## Cross-Origin Isolation

### Problem: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Errors
- **Solution:** Ensure that your server is configured to allow cross-origin requests. Use the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to specify allowed origins.

### Problem: COI Headers Not Applied
- **Solution:** Follow the steps to apply COI headers in your browser's developer tools. Refer to the [Cross-Origin Isolation Guide](src/pages/guides/develop/coi.md) for detailed instructions.

## Common Error Messages

### Error: "Module Not Found"
- **Solution:** Ensure that the module is correctly installed and that the import path is correct. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install missing modules.

### Error: "Permission Denied"
- **Solution:** Verify that you have the necessary permissions to perform the action. Check your user roles and access control settings.
