# Intermediate Learning Path: Building Functional Add-ons

**Estimated time: 8 hours**

## Path Overview

This structured path will help you build on your basic knowledge to create more sophisticated add-ons with practical real-world functionality. The learning path consists of four progressive modules that build on the fundamentals you learned in the Beginner path. By the end of this path, you'll be able to create feature-rich add-ons that manipulate document content, interact with users, and store data.

## [**Module 1: Working with Document Elements (2 hours)**](intermediate-step1.md)

In this step, you'll learn how to add, manipulate, and position different types of elements in Adobe Express documents.

**Key Concepts:**
- Adding images and text to documents
- Positioning elements with precision
- Grouping elements for organization
- Working with element properties
