# Editor APIs

The <a href="/express-add-on-apis/docs/api/classes/Editor/" target="_blank">Editor APIs</a> provide access to the user's document, allowing you to access the document structure and properties, and apply changes to it via the provided APIs.

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="warning"/>

These API's are currently **experimental only**. Please do not use them in any add-ons you plan to distribute or submit with updates until they have been deemed stable.

## Overview

Some examples of what you can do with the <a href="/express-add-on-apis/docs/api/classes/Editor/" target="_blank">Editor APIs</a> are creating shapes, adding pages to the document, clearing the artboard and more. See the following sections for more details and examples of using these new APIs.

## Access to Editor APIs

An exported `editor` module is provided to enable access to the <a href="/express-add-on-apis/docs/api/classes/Editor/" target="_blank">Editor APIs</a>. You can simply import this module into your script file code to access the methods provided below. For example:

```js
import { editor } from "express"; // named import 'editor' from express module
```

See the example below for further usage details.

## Example Code Snippet

The following code snippet illustrates how to use the <a href="/express-add-on-apis/docs/api/classes/Editor/" target="_blank">Editor APIs</a> from the script running in your `code.js` for instance, to access the current document, create a rectangle, set some properties and a fill for the rectangle, and finally, add it to the document:

```js
import { editor, utils } from "express";

const insertionParent = editor.context.insertionParent; // get node to insert content into

const rectangle = editor.createRectangle();
rectangle.width = 200;
rectangle.height = 150;
rectangle.translateX = 100;
rectangle.translateY = 20;
console.log(rectangle); // for debugging purpose

const [red, green, blue, alpha] = [0.8, 0.6, 0.2, 0.7];
const rectangleFill = editor.createColorFill(utils.createColor(red, green, blue, alpha));            
rectangle.fills.append(rectangleFill);

insertionParent.children.append(rectangle);
```

**IMPORTANT:** While using the Editor APIs in experimental mode, if you add an artboard, please be sure to **immediately add a fill**, or the document could be corrupted and unopenable. This will be fixed in the near future.

During this experimental phase, be sure to only use documented APIs when writing your add-ons. Use of undocumented APIs (which may be prefixed with an underscore, but not always) is not supported and may cause your add-on to fail or lead to document corruption. Also, we recommend you ***only test the use of these experimental APIs against non-essential documents***, due to the potential for loss or corruption.
