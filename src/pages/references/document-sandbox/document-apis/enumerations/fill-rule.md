# Enumeration: FillRule

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="warning"/>

_Do not depend on the literal numeric values of these constants_, as they may change. Always reference the enum identifiers in your code.

The fill rule, aka "winding rule," specifies how the interior area of a path is determined in cases where the path is
self-intersecting or contains separate, nested closed loops.
