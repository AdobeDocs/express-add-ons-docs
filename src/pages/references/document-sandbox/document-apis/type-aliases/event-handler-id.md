**IMPORTANT:** This is currently ***experimental only*** and should not be used in any add-ons you will be distributing until it has been declared stable. To use it, you will first need to set the `experimentalApis` flag to `true` in the [`requirements`](../../../manifest/index.md#requirements) section of the `manifest.json`.

This type represents unique id of each event handler callback that is registered.
