## Properties

### lineSpacing

• **lineSpacing**: `number`

Spacing between lines, aka leading, expressed as a multiple of the font size's default spacing - ex. 1.5 = 150% of normal.
It only affects the space *between* lines, not the space above the first line or below the last line.

---

### spaceAfter

• **spaceAfter**: `number`

Space after paragraph (in points). It does not affect the last paragraph. It is additive to the next paragraph's spaceBefore
(adjacent spacing does not merge/collapse together).

---

### spaceBefore

• **spaceBefore**: `number`

Space before paragraph (in points). It does not affect the first paragraph. It is additive to previous paragraph's spaceAfter
(adjacent spacing does not merge/collapse together).
