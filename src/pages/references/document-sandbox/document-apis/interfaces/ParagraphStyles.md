# Interface: ParagraphStyles

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="warning"/>

**IMPORTANT:** This is currently ***experimental only*** and should not be used in any add-ons you will be distributing until it has been declared stable. To use it, you will first need to set the `experimentalApis` flag to `true` in the [`requirements`](../../../manifest/index.md#requirements) section of the `manifest.json`.

Text styles that must be applied to an entire paragraph atomically. (Contrast with CharacterStyles which can be applied to
any range of characters, even a short span like one single word).

### lineSpacing

• **lineSpacing**: `number`

Spacing between lines, aka leading, expressed as a multiple of the font size's default spacing - ex. 1.5 = 150% of normal.
It only affects the space *between* lines, not the space above the first line or below the last line.
