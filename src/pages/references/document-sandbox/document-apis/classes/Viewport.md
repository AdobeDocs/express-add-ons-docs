# Class: Viewport

Represents the area of the canvas that is currently visible on-screen.

## Methods

### bringIntoView()

• **bringIntoView**(`node`): `void`

Adjusts the viewport to make the node's bounds visible on-screen, assuming all bounds are within the artboard bounds.
Makes the node's [ArtboardNode](ArtboardNode.md) or [PageNode](PageNode.md) visible if they were not already visible
(which may result in [Context.selection](Context.md#selection) being cleared). It is strongly recommended
to further draw user's attention to the node, set it as the [Context.selection](Context.md#selection) following this call.

After this call, the value of [Context.insertionParent](Context.md#insertionparent) will always be the node containing [ArtboardNode](ArtboardNode.md).

Note that the node might still not appear visible if:

- Its animation settings make it invisible at the beginning of the [ArtboardNode](ArtboardNode.md) "scene".
- It is obscured underneath other artwork in the z-order.
- It is hidden by a [GroupNode](GroupNode.md)'s mask or similar cropping.

#### Parameters

• **node**: [`VisualNode`](VisualNode.md)

#### Returns

`void`
