## What it does

> "*Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools."* â€” [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)

The **Adobe Express Add-on MCP Server (Beta)** acts as a bridge between your LLM (AI assistant) and Adobe Express add-on developer resources. It requires an MCP-compatible IDE with an LLM of your choice to provide accurate, context-aware answers for coding, debugging, and building full-fledged add-ons, quickly.

The MCP Server communicates directly with your LLM to enhance its responses by connecting your IDE to the Adobe Express Add-on ecosystem, providing capabilities to ask questions and generate code with:

- **Semantic Documentation Search**: Find relevant guides, examples, and tutorials without leaving your editor
- **TypeScript Definitions**: Get accurate code completions and reduce AI hallucinations with official SDK types
- **Structured Access**: Your LLM gets grounded information from the latest Adobe Express Add-on documentation

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (check with `node --version`) - Required to run the [Adobe Express Add-on MCP Server package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/express-add-on-dev-mcp) via `npx`
- **MCP-compatible IDE** - Such as Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code or other editors supporting the Model Context Protocol

## Quick Setup (No Installation Required)

No need to clone, install or build. Just configure your IDE with a simple json file.

### Step 1: Configure your IDE

#### For Cursor Users

Add this to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adobe-express-add-on": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@adobe/express-add-on-dev-mcp@latest",
        "--yes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Claude Desktop Users

Add this to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adobe-express-add-on": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@adobe/express-add-on-dev-mcp@latest",
        "--yes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For VS Code Users

Add this to your workspace in `~/.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adobe-express-add-on": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@adobe/express-add-on-dev-mcp@latest",
        "--yes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Verify the Connection

#### Check Connection Status

Many IDEs show a green indicator when the MCP server connects successfully, for example in Cursor:

![img](../../getting_started/local_development/img/mcp-server-enabled.png)

#### Verify with Tool calls

The LLM will automatically invoke tools based on your prompts. Here is an example of Cursor making calls to the Adobe Express Add-on MCP Server (Beta) tools to retrieve the developer documentation and type definitions based on the query. The expanded tool calls reveal the results of either the documentation source that matched the query, or the typescript definitions for the specific API in the parameters.

**Tips:"

- Ask the LLM to "*list MCP tools*".
- If you have multiple MCP servers, say: "*Use the MCP server named Adobe Express Add-on*".

## How to use it

### Usage Examples

The **Adobe Express Add-on MCP Server** excels at both helping with answering questions and generating code for Adobe Express add-ons. Here are some examples of effective prompts:

#### Documentation & Learning

- "*How do I create and style text in Adobe Express*?"
- "*What are the steps for implementing drag-and-drop functionality*?"
- "*How does the Document API work for manipulating elements*?"
- "*Show me examples of using the color picker component*?"

#### Code Generation & Implementation

- "*Implement a color picker in my add-on*"
- "*Generate code to create a text element with custom styling*"
- "*Build a drag-and-drop interface for uploading images*"
- "*Create a button that adds a rectangle to the canvas*"
- "*Write TypeScript code to handle user text input and apply it to the document*"
- "*Implement an image import feature with file validation*"
- "*Show me a sample code snippet for using a modal dialog*"

#### Debugging & Troubleshooting

- "*Why isn't my add-on loading in Adobe Express?*"
- "*Why isn't my text element appearing on the canvas?*"
- "*Debug this error when trying to add an image to the document (error message: ...)*"
- "*How do I debug an issue in my `code.js` file?*"

## Best Practices for Effective Use

<InlineAlert variant="success" slots="header, text1, text2, text3"/>

**ðŸŽ¯ &nbsp;Quick Tips**

**Ask for official documentation:** Works better when you specifically ask to "Retrieve the official documentation" to ensure the MCP server is used.

**Describe your tech stack clearly:** Include specifics like "React, Spectrum Web Components with Express theme, Modal Dialog for the popup" for more accurate responses.

**Mention your setup approach:** Works best when you call out setup instructionsâ€”indicate whether to build and run using the CLI or if you have a project that the LLM should analyze first. Starting with a project scaffolded by the Adobe Add-on CLI based on your preferred tech stack can greatly reduce setup and dependency issues.

### 1. Set Context for the Entire Conversation

- **Start your session** by describing your technical setup and visual requirements. This gives the LLM context for the entire conversation and ensures all subsequent responses are tailored to your specific tech stack.

  **Example of a well-structured prompt:**

  > "*I'm building an Adobe Express add-on using JavaScript/TypeScript and React with a UI based on Spectrum Web Components using the Express theme. My user interface needs a text field, a button, a modal dialog and a color picker. Please generate the code and show me how to set it up using the Adobe Add-on CLI.*"

  **Key elements to include:**

   - **Programming languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
   - **Framework**: React
   - **UI components**: Spectrum Web Components with Express theme using [swc-react](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/using-swc-react/)
   - **Specific components needed**: Modal dialog, color picker, buttons, etc.
   - **Build tools**: Adobe Add-on CLI for setup and development

### 2. Craft Effective Prompts

  - **Be Specific**: "*Add a stroke to a rectangle*" vs "*Style shapes*"
  - **Include Context**: "*I'm building a text editor add-on*" helps narrow results
  - **Use Technical Terms**: "*text styling*" vs "*make it look good*"
  - **Ask for Examples**: "*Show me code examples for text manipulation*"
  - **Request Code Generation**: "*Generate TypeScript code to...*" or "*Implement a feature that...*"

### 3. Manage Your Sessions

- **Keep Sessions Focused**: Start new conversations for different features or topics
- **Be Explicit**: Tell the agent "*For Adobe Express Add-ons questions, prefer the Adobe Express Add-on MCP tools and cite sources.*"
- **Provide Context**: Mention what you're building and your current progress
- **Iterate Gradually**: Build features step-by-step rather than asking for complete applications
- **Avoid Getting Stuck in Debugging Loops**:

  - If the LLM keeps suggesting fixes that don't work, start fresh with a new conversation
  - Save your working code frequently using version control branches
  - When debugging fails repeatedly, try a different approach or even switch to a different LLM model
  - It's often faster to restart with a clear problem description than to keep correcting a confused AI assistant

### 4. Using LLM Rules

Custom rules can help guide your LLM's responses, but they require careful design and testing to ensure they work as intended.

**Best Practices:**

- Test your rules thoroughly before relying on them
- Focus on positive guidance rather than restrictions
- Be specific about what you want, not just what you want to avoid
- Avoid overly restrictive rules:

  - Rules that focus on "never do X" or "cannot do Y" can backfire
  - LLMs may over-prioritize avoiding the restriction and neglect coding fundamentals
  - Instead of "*Never use inline styles*," try "*Prefer CSS classes and external stylesheets for maintainability*"

#### 4.1 Example Rules for Cursor

Here are some example rules that have proven helpful for Adobe Express add-on development in Cursor. Feel free to adapt them for your own use:

```text
  - Use adobe-express-add-on MCP server for questions about Express Add-ons, Express API, CLI, and SDK before web search.
  - Add-ons are bundled and served in the browser as an iFrame. 
  - Both the Add-on UI and "Express document sandbox" are isolated and must communicate through a proxy layer.
  - The term "document" most often refers to terminology related to Express Add-ons since the regular browser DOM isn't available in the sandboxed environment.
```

### 5. Pro UI Tips

Consider using the following tips in your prompts/rules for LLM guidance when using [Spectrum Web Components (SWC)](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/index.html) or the [swc-react](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/using-swc-react/) wrappers library for React-based add-ons. These tips help your LLM generate UI code for add-ons.

#### Using **[Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/index.html)** (add-ons NOT using React)
