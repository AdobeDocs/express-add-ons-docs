# Our Review Process

## Overview

We’ve created the Adobe Express add-ons marketplace so that Adobe users can benefit from amazing ideas from our developer community - including you.

Whether you’re creating new features or speeding up user workflows, we want you to use your imagination. 

But we want every add-on to perform as smoothly as possible, which is why each submission goes through a thorough review process before being accepted.

## Review Criteria

Our marketplace reviewers will assess your submission based on a variety of factors, including:

- Branding
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Harmful or unacceptable content
- User Experience
- Transparency
- Presence of bugs or harmful code
- Compatibility with operating systems, browsers, devices and other add-ons

**We aim to review your add-on within 10 business days of submission, and will let you know if it is accepted, or if any changes need to be made.**
