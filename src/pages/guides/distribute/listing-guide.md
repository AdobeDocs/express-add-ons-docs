#### Add-on package

As part of your submission, you will upload your add-on package. Take the following steps to create your add-on package.

1. Compress your add-on files as a **.zip** file

   - Select all files within your add-on's parent folder. On both macOS and Windows you can right-click to compress:

     **macOS**:
     Right-click > Compress items

     **Windows**:
     Right-click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder

     **Note:** You should _not_ compress the add-on's parent folder. Instead, compress the contents of the parent folder. Failure to do so will likely cause a rejection when submitting.
