# Listing Your Add-on

Your listing should provide valuable information about what your add-on does, and why people should use it.

**NOTE:** When writing your listing details, do not use emojis or exclamation marks. Refer to [Adobe brand guidelines](../brand_guidelines.md) for more information.

### Naming your add-on

Your add-on name should be original.

Consider using a simple name that is easy to spell, but distinctive enough to find using search.

Choose a name that gives users an idea of what the add-on does. For example, using a company name may be clear to you, but not to other users. Try to avoid a long or generic name.

### Your add-on description

Let your users know clearly and concisely what your add-on does. 

Think of this as your elevator pitch. Use this space to concisely capture the attention of a user and tell them why they should use your add-on, using tone and language which is appropriate to your add-on and your own personal or brand style.

If your add-on generates assets via AI or imports assets from an asset repository, you should include accurate and up-to-date information about usage rights here.

Consult our [Generative AI guidelines](../genai/) for more information.


### Your summary

Use the summary section to concisely outline the features and functionality of the add-on. Think of this as the tagline to your add-on.

### Support email

You should always provide a valid email address so that customers can contact you for support.

### Screenshots

Your screenshots should give users a flavor of what the add-on does and how it looks. Consider showing images that show key features, and important user steps.
Do not add any images which are misleading or inappropriate.

### Your icon

Use an original icon that meets [Adobe Brand Guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf). Consider using a design that illustrates what the add-on does.

Your icon should be simple, distinctive, and suitable for viewing on different devices and browsers.

### Help URL

Include a link to a valid webpage that provides accurate and relevant information about the add-on’s usage and functionality.

Consider adding support for common queries or user issues.

### Privacy Policy/License Agreement

Include details of your policy and agreements. Do not include text that violates Adobe Brand Guidelines.

### Keywords

You can include keywords to categorize your add-on and make it easier to find. Multi-word keywords are allowed (but remember: spaces count toward the overall character limit for keywords). 

Try to include keywords which reflect the features and purpose of the add-on, which the user is likely to search for. Spell out keywords in full. Do not include any words that are abusive and/or derogatory.

### Release section

Use this section to include details of any updates, fixes and improvements you have made to the add-on since launch.

These notes should accurately describe the changes made, and be written in such a way that they make sense to the user.

## Publisher profile

Your publisher profile contains information about you as a company or developer as a whole. Once you've submitted this information and it has been approved by Adobe, it will be shown for all add-ons and integrations you publish with Adobe.

A good publisher profile can make you look more professional, interesting and trustworthy.

Ensure that all content adheres to [our brand guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf).

### Your publisher name

Create a unique name that reflects your personality. It should not contain inappropriate words or phrases. 

### Your description

Use your description to explain a little more about you, including any areas you may specialize in.

### Your logo

Your publisher logo should be original. You should not use the Adobe logo, or any product icons or images, without authorization.

### Your website URL

Include a website so that people can find out more about you. This should successfully open your own website.

**IMPORTANT:** You must complete and submit your publisher profile in order to submit your first add-on, however this is only a one-time thing (unless you decide you need to update it for your own reasons). **Note:** Any changes to your publisher profile will need to be submitted for approval again.

Frequently changing your publisher profile can confuse users and erode trust. Please be sure you've considered this before changing this information.
