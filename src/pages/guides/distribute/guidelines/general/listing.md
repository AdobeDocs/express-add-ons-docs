**NOTE:** When writing, do not use emojis or exclamation marks.

Refer to [Adobe brand guidelines](../brand_guidelines.md) for more information.


## Naming your add-on

Your add-on name should be original.

Consider using a simple name that is easy to spell, but distinctive enough to find using search.

Choose a name that gives users an idea of what the add-on does. For example, using a company name may be clear to you, but not to other users. Try to avoid a long or generic name.

## Your add-on description

Let your users know clearly and concisely what your add-on does. 

Think of this as your elevator pitch. Use this space to concisely capture the attention of a user and tell them why they should use your add-on, using tone and language which is appropriate to your add-on and your own personal or brand style.

If your add-on generates assets via AI or imports assets from an asset repository, you should include accurate and up-to-date information about usage rights here.

Consult our Generative AI guidelines for more information.


## Your summary

Use the summary section to concisely outline the features and functionality of the add-on. Think of this as the tagline to your add-on.

## Support email

You should always provide a valid email address so that customers can contact you for support.

## Screenshots

Your screenshots should give users a flavor of what the add-on does and how it looks. Consider showing images that show key features, and important user steps.
Do not add any images which are misleading or inappropriate.

## Your icon

Use an original icon that meets [Adobe Brand Guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf). Consider using a design that illustrates what the add-on does.

Your icon should be simple, distinctive, and suitable for viewing on different devices and browsers.

## Help URL

Include a link to a valid webpage that provides accurate and relevant information about the add-onâ€™s usage and functionality.

Consider adding support for common queries or user issues.

## Privacy Policy/License Agreement

Include details of your policy and agreements. Do not include text that violates Adobe Brand Guidelines.

## Keywords

You can include keywords to categorize your add-on and make it easier to find. Multi-word keywords are allowed (but remember: spaces count toward the overall character limit for keywords). 

Try to include keywords which reflect the features and purpose of the add-on, which the user is likely to search for. Spell out keywords in full. Do not include any words that are abusive and/or derogatory.

## Release section

Use this section to include details of any updates, fixes and improvements you have made to the add-on since launch.

These notes should accurately describe the changes made, and be written in such a way that they make sense to the user.
