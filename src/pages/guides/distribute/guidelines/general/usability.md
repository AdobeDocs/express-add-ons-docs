# Usability

Follow these guidelines to make sure that your add-on meets our usability standards before submitting.

## Blending with Adobe Express UI

The add-on should integrate seamlessly with Adobe Express UI,  incorporating commonly-used patterns within the Adobe Express UI to facilitate user navigation.

We also suggest that you use the [Adobe Spectrum theme for Adobe Express](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/theming/#Resources-for-Spectrum-for-Adobe-Express). It is not mandatory to use [Adobe’s Spectrum libraries](https://spectrum.adobe.com/)  for your add-on, but it can significantly simplify the development process.

## Responsive interface

You must make sure that your add-on’s user interface and controls are responsive, functional and usable across different browsers and screen sizes.

## User inputs

The add-on must provide some sort of response or validation for user inputs, such as confirmation messages for successful actions or error messages for invalid inputs.

## Error messages

Any error messages, warnings or notifications should be clear, informative and helpful to the user.

## Modal dialogs

The add-on should not interrupt the user’s workflow unnecessarily with dialog boxes. These boxes should only be used for important messages. Messages such as “success” notifications should be rendered inside the add-on’s UI panel instead.
