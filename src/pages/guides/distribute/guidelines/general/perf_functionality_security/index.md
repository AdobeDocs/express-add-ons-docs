# Functionality and Testing
This section includes a set of guides to help you ensure your add-on functions well, performs well and is properly tested.

## Building the best experience

Testing is a hugely important part of the add-on creation process. It ensures that the add-on is free from bugs, works as intended, and performs smoothly.

We advise that you test your add-on rigorously before submitting it for review, to avoid rejection or delays in submission.
