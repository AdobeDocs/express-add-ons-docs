# Publisher Profile

Your publisher profile contains information about you as a company or developer as a whole. Once you've submitted this information and it has been approved by Adobe, it will be shown for all add-ons and integrations you publish with Adobe.

A good publisher profile can make you look more professional, interesting and trustworthy.

Ensure that all content adheres to [our brand guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf).

## Your publisher name

Create a unique name that reflects your personality. It should not contain inappropriate words or phrases. 

## Your description

Use your description to explain a little more about you, including any areas you may specialize in.

## Your logo

Your publisher logo should be original. You should not use the Adobe logo, or any product icons or images, without authorization.

## Your website URL

Include a website so that people can find out more about you. This should successfully open your own website.

**IMPORTANT:** You must complete and submit your publisher profile in order to submit your first add-on, however this is only a one-time thing (unless you decide you need to update it for your own reasons). **Note:** Any changes to your publisher profile will need to be submitted for approval again.

Frequently changing your publisher profile can confuse users and erode trust. Please be sure you've considered this before changing this information.
