# User Interface

## Your add-on design

When it comes to design, feel free to use your imagination and create the layout that works best for what your add-on does.

However, remember that your users will be accessing your add-on as part of their Adobe Express workflow - so try to make sure they can move seamlessly without coming across anything jarring or counter-intuitive.

We’ve included these guidelines here to help you create a great experience for users. Also refer to our [User interface design guide](../../../design//user_interface.md), which includes a comprehensive set of [UX Guidelines](https://xd.adobe.com/view/urn:aaid:sc:US:fd638450-1af8-49c3-ad29-0e76c2a2136f/) to help with your add-on design.

## Display Items

Here are some tips to make sure your layout works effectively, from display to icons.

### Meaningful content

All screens within your add-on should feature at least some meaningful information.

You should avoid including any empty screens in your design.

### Scroll bars

If your content does not fully fit on a single screen, make it clear that the user can scroll to view the remaining content.

### Buttons

All add-on buttons should be displayed correctly, and not overlap with each other.

### Changing between languages

The user interface should still be clear and navigable when the user switches between languages.

They should also be able to input special characters or alphabets from other languages without causing malfunctions.

### Dialog boxes

Try to avoid using dialog boxes that interrupt the user’s workflow, except in important situations. 

For example, use the in-panel UI to display things like success messages, rather than a dialog box.

### Icons

Use unique icons to represent the add-on itself, and the features within it. Consider working with a designer to create icons that are clear and distinct.


## Using Adobe icons and phrasing

Follow these guidelines to make sure you are referring to Adobe correctly in your add-on.

For more information on using Adobe brand assets, check our [brand guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf).

### Referring to add-ons

Always use the spelling “add-on”, NOT “addon” or “plugin”.

Referring to Adobe Express

Always use the full name “Adobe Express” when referring to the tool.

Do not shorten it to “Express”.

### Using Adobe Icons

Do not use any icons or visual elements specifically associated with Adobe or Adobe Express to represent your add-on features. 

This removes confusion around what the features do, and who has created them.

### Referring to stock photos

If your copy includes any mention of stock content or assets within Adobe Express, please refer to it with a lower case “s” (ie. stock).

This avoids confusion with Adobe Stock, which is a separate service.

For example:

“Discover a wide range of high-quality stock photos in Adobe Express”

## Localization

We require all add-ons to provide support for the English language. In addition, you are welcome to create your add-on in any other supported language.

### Functionality for Multilingual UI

Test your add-on to make sure that the user interface remains intact and functional when you switch between any supported languages.

### Text display

Ensure that changing the language does not result in add-on strings or text content being cut-off or truncated. All text should be visible and displayed appropriately on the add-on in all supported languages.
