# Compatibility

Your add-on will help the user to make the most of their Adobe Express experience, so itâ€™s important that it feels like part of their workflow.

## Conflicts

Your add-on should not conflict with any other installed add-ons in Adobe Express.

## Different systems and browsers

Your add-on should work on the same browsers and operating systems supported by Adobe Express.

Add-ons should perform well on machines of varying performance characteristics. Adobe Express is supported on Chromebooks and machines with low resolution and limited memory. Don't assume that your users have powerful computers.

Add-ons are not currently supported on mobile devices. This will change in the future, so you should ensure that your add-on adheres to responsive design principles and can adapt to different panel sizes so that you can be prepared when mobile support is available.
