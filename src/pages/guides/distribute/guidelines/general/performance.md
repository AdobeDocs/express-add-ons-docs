# Performance
If you want your add-on to become a key part of a user’s workflow, you must make sure it performs smoothly and efficiently.

## Overview
Your add-on should meet acceptable standards in terms of loading time, response time and utilization of resources. You should also bear in mind that a user’s experience may differ, based on factors such as their network connection.

Below is a list of a few things to consider before submitting for review.

## Crashes

Your add-on should not cause any slowdowns or crashes on Adobe Express.

## System resources

You should ensure your add-on does not consume excessive system resources which may affect the performance of the user’s system, or Adobe Express itself. This includes resources such as CPU and memory.

## Network calls

Your add-on should not make an excessive amount of network calls. You can monitor this by noting the number of network calls made over a certain period, and comparing it to a predetermined threshold.

## Network efficiency

Make sure your add-on is network efficient and does not have any performance issues. You can do this by noting the time it takes to complete a network call and how much data is transferred.

## Network usage

We recommend using network monitoring tools to identify any unexpected or excessive network activity caused by the add-on.

## Network security

Your add-on should not pose any security risks, and network calls should be secure. We advise using secure protocols, encrypting sensitive data, and implementing appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Network call logs

Review your network call logs to identify any anomalies or notable patterns in network usage. This helps you identify any issues related to network calls.
