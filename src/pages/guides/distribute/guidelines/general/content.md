# Unacceptable and Restricted Content

## Unacceptable Content

In the interests of user safety and acceptable standards, add-ons should not contain or generate any of the following types of content:

### No adult content
Add-ons must not contain intense violence, blood, gore, sexual content, nudity or strong language.

### No malicious content of any kind
Add-ons must not contain or promote (for example) phishing, spamming, hacking, password trafficking, spyware, or contain malware, trojans, or viruses. All submissions are run through a virus and malware scan to ensure that the codebase is free of malware. If we find evidence of a virus or malware, your packaged file will either fail to upload or be rejected.

### No illegal or questionable content

Add-ons must not contain or promote illegal or highly-regulated activities. For example, pharmaceutical sales, promotions or sweepstakes, alcohol or tobacco sales. 

Add-ons must not violate intellectual property rights. For example, add-ons must not promote DRM circumvention, or contain copyrighted or trademarked content belonging to someone else.

Add-ons must not promote hatred, violence, or bullying. For example, add-ons must not contain hate speech, or promote or enable cruel behavior towards others.
