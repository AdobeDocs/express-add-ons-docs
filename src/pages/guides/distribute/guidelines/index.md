# Introduction

Thank you for joining the community of developers worldwide that are creating add-ons for Adobe Express.

At Adobe, we want to make sure that all add-ons that appear on the Adobe marketplace meet the highest quality standards, and provide great experiences for users.

## Guideline Categories
We’ve created this set of guidelines to give you some tips on best practices, and ensure you take the right steps to get your add-on approved:

- [General guidelines](./general/)
- [Brand guidelines](./brand_guidelines.md)
- [Monetization guidelines](./monetization.md)
- [Generative AI guidelines](./genai/)

## Planning your add-on

### Choosing your idea

The best way to get attention on the marketplace is to create an add-on that’s useful, exciting and original.

Before you start, do a little research to see what other developers are doing, and where you can make an impact. Ask yourself the following questions while you're considering the add-on you want to build.

#### Useful

Does my add-on help users to do their work quicker and more effectively?

Does it help their process make more sense?

#### Exciting

Does my add-on enable users to be more creative, or make their work look better?

#### Original

Are there lots of add-ons already doing the same thing on the marketplace?

#### Use of AI

Does your add-on leverage AI to generate content or automate workflows? If so, be sure to check out the [Generative AI requirements](./genai/). -->
