## Considerations for Monetization

Developers who submit to the marketplace can charge users for using their add-ons.

We recommend that you consider whether you want to monetize your add-on at the outset, as it helps you plan your strategy more effectively.

Remember to research the marketplace carefully before you start creating add-ons. This will help you learn whether there is a strong market for a paid add-on – and what other developers (if any) are charging for similar solutions.

<!-- ## Payment Models

You can choose from a variety of models for your add-on. Take the time to consider which one suits your needs best.

### Free

Users are not charged for adding and using the add-on.

## Freemium

This model offers a basic version for free, but users must upgrade to a paid version for extra features and content. This payment could be a one-time fee or subscription.

Freemium add-ons have a high percentage of acquisition in our marketplace, making this our recommended option.

### Paid

This requires users to pay a fee before using the add-on. You may wish to offer a trial period at the outset, in which users can test out the add-on for a certain period of time before deciding whether to pay.

### Sign-up for service (SaaS)

The add-on requires the user to have access to external services before they can use it.

### Credits

This model asks users to buy credits which can be used for services on the add-on. This can be used for things such as licensing images or trying out Generative AI models. Many add-ons offer users some free credits to start so they can test out the service. -->

## Our Monetization Guidelines

We’ve created these standards to ensure that monetized add-ons provide users with a consistent and reliable experience.

### Transparency

All add-on developers must be transparent about their pricing and monetization methods. This includes being honest about the price, recurring fees, or additional costs.

Users must be able to:

- Locate clear instructions on requesting refund (please place a refund policy on your site).
- Find a way to cancel any recurring payments, including subscriptions.
- Manage update their payment methods.
- Clearly see how much an add-on will cost them, with no hidden fees or surprise charges.

### Support

You must offer a clear and simple support process for all publicly-listed add-ons. This includes responding to any queries from users regarding access and payments.

### Compliance

You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes payment regulations, taxation, data privacy, and security.

### Third-party ads

Your add-ons must not contain third-party advertising, including any ads from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or other ad networks.

This applies to advertising products and services within the add-on description and using banners in the add-on itself.

### Complying with Express Monetization rules

It would be best not to use "Premium" to describe your upgrade options when listing an Adobe Express add-on.

The word "Premium" should only be used in relation to the Adobe Express Premium Plan, which provides users with extra content, increased storage, and more.

### Exporting Premium content

Adobe Express allows users who aren't subscribed to a premium version of Adobe Express to experiment with premium content in their documents. When users download or share their documents, they'll be prompted to upgrade to a premium plan.

Add-ons must not allow users on a free plan to download, share, or export premium content provided by Adobe Express. When a user on a free plan tries to share or export premium content using your add-on, you must notify the user that they need to upgradeand inform the user how they can do so.

See our [documentation](../../develop/use_cases.md#premium-content) for more information on how to do this.

### Recommended Practices for Monetization

We recommend following these tips to make your add-on more user friendly and to avoid potential confusion:

#### Offer a choice

We recommend giving users a choice of payment options when signing up or upgrading. This includes:

- A choice of payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal, and other popular alternatives.
- A choice of payment terms. When users sign up for a subscription or pay as they use, try to provide short and long-term payment options, such as monthly and annual terms.
- Giving users the chance to try before they buy. Free trials and freemium options can improve sign-up numbers.

<!-- - Differentiate between “free” and “trial”

- These words are not interchangeable. “Free” tends to mean that users will not be charged for content while it is published and available.

- “Trial” means that content is free for a limited time. A “free trial” means that the user will not be charged for content for a set period, at which point they will need to pay a fee to access it. -->

- Avoid using “Pro”.
- Adobe Express caters to non-professional and professional users, so you should avoid using "Pro" in your language.
- If “Pro” refers to a pricing model, make this clear (for example, by saying “Pro Plan”).

#### Consider user action

Instead of using words such as “premium” or “gold” in your copy, you should try using words that clarify what the user needs to do.

Words such as “upgrade” or “subscribe” are clearer and more user-friendly.

For example, instead of:

*“You’re using the trial version. Go Premium”*

Try:

*“You’re using the trial version. Upgrade today”*

Also, consider adjusting your language to make the benefits of upgrading clearer.

For example, instead of:

*“This item is premium”*

Try:

*“Subscribe to access unlimited illustrations like these”*

### Branding assets

When building your monetization checkout experience, you can use the approved colors, gradients, and iconography to communicate when content or features in your add-on require purchase and when content or features are paid and unlocked.

#### Plus badge

Use the gradient plus badge below to indicate when content or features require purchase:
