# Monetization guidelines
Considerations for monetization.

## Overview
Developers who submit to the marketplace are allowed to charge users for the use of their add-ons.

It is worth considering whether you want to monetize your add-on at the outset, as it helps you plan your strategy more effectively.

Remember to research the marketplace carefully before you start creating. This will help you learn whether there is a strong market for a paid add-on - and what other developers (if any) are charging for similar solutions.

In the future, we will be releasing badges which help Adobe Express users to identify add-ons which require additional payment.

## Payment Models

You can choose from a variety of models for your add-on. Take the time to consider which one suits your needs best.

### Free

Users are not charged for adding and using the add-on.

### Freemium

This model offers a basic version for free, but users must upgrade to a paid version for extra features and content. This payment could be a one-time fee or subscription.

Freemium add-ons tend to enjoy the highest percentage of acquisition in our marketplace, making it our recommended option.

### Paid

This requires users to pay a fee before using the add-on. You may wish to offer a Trial period at the outset, in which users can test out the add-on for a certain period of time before deciding whether to pay.

### Sign-up for service (SaaS)

The add-on requires the user to have access to external services before they can use it


### Credits

This model asks users to buy credits which can be used for services on the add-on. This can be used for things such as licensing images or trying out Generative AI models. It is common to provide some free credits to start so users can test out the service.
Our Monetization Guidelines


We’ve created these standards to ensure that monetized add-ons provide users with a high-quality experience. 

## Transparency

We require all add-on developers to be transparent about their pricing and monetization methods. This includes being honest about the price, and any recurring fees or additional costs.

Users should be able to:

- Locate clear instructions on how to request a refund (please place a Refund Policy on your site)
- Find a way to cancel any recurring payments, including subscriptions
- Manage their payments and update their payment method
- Clearly see how much an add-on will cost them, with no hidden fees or surprise charges

## Support

You must offer a clear and simple support process for all publicly-listed add-ons. This includes responding to any queries from users regarding access and payments.

## Compliance

You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes regulations relating to payments, taxation, data privacy, and security.


## Third-party ads

Your add-ons must not contain any third-party advertising, including any ads from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or any other ad networks.

## Complying with Express Monetization rules

When listing an Adobe Express add-on, you should not use the word “Premium” to describe your upgrade options.

The word “Premium” should only be used in relation to the Adobe Express Premium Plan, which provides users with extra content, increased storage and more.

## Exporting Premium content

The add-on must not allow free users to export any Adobe Express Premium Plan content.

## Best Practices for Monetization

We recommend following these tips to make your add-on more user friendly, and to avoid potential confusion.

### Offer a choice

We advise giving users a choice of payment options when signing up or upgrading. This includes:

- A choice of payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal and other popular alternatives.
- A choice of payment terms. When signing up for subscription or pay-as-you-go, try to provide short and long term payment options, such as monthly and annual terms.
- Giving users the chance to try before they buy. Free trials and freemium options can improve sign-up numbers.
 
### Differentiate between “free” and “trial”

These words are not interchangeable. “Free” tends to mean that users will not be charged for content while it is published and available.

“Trial” means that content is free for a limited time. A “free trial” means that the user will not be charged for content for a set period, at which point they will need to pay a fee to access it.

### Avoid using “Pro”

Adobe Express caters to non-professional as well as professional users, so try to avoid using “pro” in your language.

If “pro” refers to a pricing model, make this clear (for example, by saying “Pro Plan”).

### Consider user action

Instead of using words such as “premium” or “gold” in your copy, try using words that make it clear what the user needs to do.

Words such as “upgrade” or “subscribe” are clearer and more user-friendly.

For example, instead of:

*“You’re using the trial version. Go Premium”*

Try:

*“You’re using the trial version. Upgrade today”*

Also, consider adjusting your language to make the benefits of upgrading clearer.

For example, instead of:

*“This item is premium”*

Try:

*“Subscribe to access unlimited illustrations like these”*
