# Generative AI Guidelines
Guidelines on how to meet Adobe’s requirements around Generative AI.

## Introduction
This set of guidelines gives you the latest information on how to meet Adobe’s requirements around Generative AI, including:

- Acceptable content
- Restricted content
- Proper transparency when using Gen AI content
- Testing and security

We will edit and update this guide as our requirements and the technology evolve.

## Overview
The rise of Generative AI could offer many benefits for add-ons, particularly in helping users create content and speed up their workflows.

However, it also means it is possible for users to be exposed to inappropriate or offensive content on a large scale, even if the add-on’s own code bundle and assets technically meet requirements.

Adobe encourages users to be able to choose whether they want to try add-ons that employ Generative AI technology. But we want to make sure that this is clearly stated upfront - and that the content they receive is appropriate and respects intellectual property (including copyrights and trademarks).

We created these guidelines to assist any developers who wish to take advantage of Generative AI in their add-ons, to make sure they do so sensibly, ethically and in line with Adobe standards.

We have split these guides into three sections:
- [Restrictions](./restrictions.md) (which must not be included or carried out)
- [Requirements](./requirements.md) (which must be followed)
- [Guidelines](./guidelines.md) (which are suggestions we encourage for best practice)

If your add-on does not meet the required criteria, your submission will be rejected. If an issue is discovered, and your add-on is already listed in the marketplace, you’ll be contacted and given thirty (30) days to resolve the issue or risk being removed from the marketplace.

Add-ons that are listed privately are not required to undergo automated testing. However you should not use private add-ons as a way to avoid ensuring the safety of your add-on when sharing it with users. 

If we receive reports of abuse, we may elect to remove an add-on whether it is private or public.
