# Building UIs using Adobe's Spectrum Design System

This tutorial will guide you on how to get started building great UI's for your add-ons using [Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/).

This tutorial was also presented in a recorded workshop that can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PA4KEN4JdQ).

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build two fully functioning [Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com/) add-ons from scratch that use [Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/) for building the user interface. The concept for the add-on you will build is a bingo card generator, which allows a user to customize a bingo card with their chosen colors, random numbers and an optional FREE space.

The two different add-on's you will create are:

- A basic JavaScript add-on that uses [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/) to build out the UI.

- A React-based add-on that uses the [`swc-react` Spectrum Web Components wrapper library](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/design/user_interface/#spectrum-web-components-with-react).

An example of what you will build is shown below:

![Bingo add-on screenshot](../images/bingo-v1-addon.png)

This add-on allows users to select settings to customize a bingo card; including background, foreground, title color, gridline size and whether to include a "FREE" space. The card is generated with random numbers, and ensures no numbers are used twice. The user can drag the customized card to the page, or click the "Add to page" button to use it in their document.

## Quickstart: Try Spectrum Web Components

A quick way to try out [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/) without requiring any external tools, is to use a sandboxed environment like a codepen. See this [simple codepen](https://codepen.io/hollyschinsky/pen/xxBweyV), for example. It references the Spectrum Web Components libraries as bundles from a CDN for simplicity, and shows how to use the Express theme with a button component.

Check out [the codepen](https://codepen.io/hollyschinsky/pen/xxBweyV0), then try changing the `scale` value in the `<sp-theme>` tag to a value of `"large"` - then back to `"medium"` to see the effect.

**NOTE:** You can try using any other Spectrum Web Components in a similar fashion, ensuring they're included within the opening `<sp-theme>` and closing `</sp-theme>` tags.

Before moving on, check out [this codepen](https://codepen.io/hollyschinsky/pen/bGZrdoy) which implements the UI for the bingo card generator add-on and gives you a glimpse of what you're going to be building. You can change the layout to represent how it might look running in Express, by clicking the layout icon button outlined below, and dragging the width of the frame to 320px:

CDN URL references are used to show you a quick way to get started with Spectrum Web Components. However, you will notice the UI is laggy, so you wouldn't want to use this for your final add-on projects for performance reasons. In the following lessons, you will learn how to configure your projects to use only the modules and components your UI needs to ensure the best performance for your add-ons.
