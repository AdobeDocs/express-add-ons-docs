# Introduction to Spectrum

Adobe provides the [Spectrum Design System](https://spectrum.adobe.com/) which contains a comprehensive set of design guidelines, components and tools to help designers create a consistent user experience across products. It's also available in the following open-source implementations to cover a variety of needs. There are a few different implementations of Spectrum that are listed here for reference and in order of preferred use. Leveraging Spectrum in your add-on allows you to take advantage of all of the built-in benefits it provides while saving front-end development time.

Check out our [code samples](../../samples.md) for examples of how to use the libraries described here. Refer to the **export-sample** and **Pix** sample for a reference on using **Spectrum Web Components**, and the **Dropbox** and **import-images-using-oauth** for specific examples using **React Spectrum**.

## Spectrum Web Components

The [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/) project is an implementation of Spectrum designed to work with any web framework with a number of benefits, including:

-   Framework agnostic
-   Lightweight
-   Accessible by default
-   Standards based

To use Spectrum Web Components (SWC), follow these steps:

Install the `@spectrum-web-components` package using a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`. For example, run the following command in your project directory:

`npm install --save @spectrum-web-components`

Import the SWC components that you want to use in your web application. For example, to use the `sp-button` component, add the following import statement to your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```js
import "@spectrum-web-components/button";
```

Use the imported SWC component in your HTML code. For example, in the case of the `sp-button` component, you can use it with the following:

```html
<sp-button variant="cta" size="large">Click me!</sp-button>
```

This will render a button with the "Call to Action" variant and "Large" size.

You can customize the SWC components by passing in attributes to the HTML tags. For instance, to change the color of a button, add the `color` attribute:

```html
<sp-button variant="cta" size="large" color="red">Click me!</sp-button>
```

This will render a button with a red color.

Continue adding components and styling with attributes as desired. See the [official documentation](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/index.html) for a comprehensive list of all of the available components you can use in your add-ons.

### Spectrum Web Components with React

[**swc-react**](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/using-swc-react/) is a collection of React wrapper components for the Spectrum Web Components (SWC) library, enabling you to use SWC in your React applications with ease.

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="success"/>

We **highly** recommend choosing to use Spectrum Web Components (or [swc-react](#spectrum-web-components-with-react)) for your add-ons since it currently offers the most comprehensive set of components and built-in benefits.

## React Spectrum

[React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html) is a project that implements the Adobe's Spectrum design language into React UI components.

React Spectrum is composed of three parts:

-   **react-spectrum**: a component library implementing the Adobe Spectrum design system
-   **react-aria**: a library of React hooks implementing the patterns defined in the ARIA practices spec, including mouse, touch, and keyboard behavior, accessibility, and internationalization support
-   **react-stately**: a library of React hooks implementing cross platform (e.g. web/native) state management for components that need it.

To use React Spectrum, follow these steps:

1. Install the `@adobe/react-spectrum package` using a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`. For example, run the following command in your project directory:

`npm install --save @adobe/react-spectrum`

2. Import the React Spectrum components you want to use in your React component. For example, to use the `Button` component, add the following import statement to your React component:

`import { Button } from '@adobe/react-spectrum';`

3. Use the imported Spectrum React component in your React component. For example, to use the `Button` component, add the following code to your React component:

```js
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "@adobe/react-spectrum";

function MyButton(props) {
    return (
        <Button variant={props.variant} size={props.size}>
            {props.label}
        </Button>
    );
}

export default MyButton;
```

This component takes in `variant`, `size`, and `label` props and renders a `Button` component with the specified props.

Use the `Provider` component to wrap your application. This is required for Spectrum React to work correctly. For example:

```js
import React from "react";
import { Provider, defaultTheme } from "@adobe/react-spectrum";
import MyButton from "./MyButton";

function App() {
    return (
        <Provider theme={defaultTheme}>
            <MyButton variant="cta" size="L">
                Click me!
            </MyButton>
        </Provider>
    );
}

export default App;
```

This component wraps the `MyButton` component with the `Provider` component, which provides the Spectrum React theme and other context to the component.

That's it! You can now use Spectrum React to build your web application with Spectrum design. For more information on using Spectrum React, you can refer to the official documentation at https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/.

## Spectrum CSS

[Spectrum CSS](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/) is an open-source implementation of Spectrum and includes components and resources to make applications more cohesive. Spectrum CSS is designed to be used in partnership with [Spectrumâ€™s detailed usage guidelines](https://spectrum.adobe.com/).

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="warning"/>

You should only rely on using the base [Spectrum CSS](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/) library for simple applications that need basic things like typography, checkboxes, text fields, etc. Otherwise you should try using one of the other implementations provided like [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/) and [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html) since they include interactivity, event handling etc built-in over what's possible with pure CSS. The best place to start with each of these libraries is to go to the **Getting Started** page in the top of the docs for each.

<!--
To get started with Spectrum CSS, follow these steps:

### 1. Include the Spectrum CSS file in your HTML file by adding the following link tag to the `head` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@spectrum-css/spectrum-css@3.9.0/dist/spectrum.min.css">
```

This will download and include the latest version of Spectrum CSS in your web page.

Use the Spectrum CSS classes to style your HTML elements. For example, to style a button with the "primary" variant, add the following HTML code:

```html
    <button class="spectrum-Button spectrum-Button--primary">Click me!</button>
```

This will render a button styled with the "primary" variant.

You can also customize the Spectrum CSS styles by overriding the default CSS variables. For example, to change the color of the "primary" variant, add the following CSS code to your stylesheet:

```css
    :root {
    --spectrum-global-color-primary: #ff0000;
    }
```

This will change the color of all elements with the "primary" variant to red.

That's it! You can now use Spectrum CSS to style your web pages. For more information on using Spectrum CSS, you can refer to the official documentation at https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/. -->

### Spectrum Express Theme

If you want your add-on UI to match the [Express look-and-feel](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/theming/#Resources-for-Spectrum-for-Adobe-Express), you can find Express-themed components available within the [Spectrum CSS](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css), [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/tools/theme/) and [React Spectrum](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-spectrum/theme-express) libraries.

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="info"/>

The [React Spectrum Express theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-spectrum/theme-express) is still in an alpha state, but you can use [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/tools/theme/) with React as well. See the **Pix** code sample in the provided samples for an example of how to mix Spectrum Web Components with React. Specifically, you should note that there are some intricacies when using this combination of Spectrum Web Components and React in terms of event handling, but they can be handled by using a component that wraps the Spectrum Web Components for providing the event handling instead. In the **Pix** sample, take a look at the wrapper component called `WC.jsx` for a reference of how to do this.

#### Spectrum Web Components with Express Theme Steps

-   Install the `spectrum-web-components` packages you would like to use. The `theme` package is one you will always want to specify, but the others are being shown for illustration purposes. You can choose which components you will be using in your add-on and install them as needed. See the [Spectrum Web Components site](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/getting-started/) for all of the components available.

```bash
npm install @spectrum-web-components/theme
npm install @spectrum-web-components/field-label
npm install @spectrum-web-components/textfield
npm install @spectrum-web-components/button
```

-   Next, start adding your imports. All add-ons should have this base set of imports, which provide support for Spectrum typography, the Express themes, including colors (lightest, light, dark, and darkest) and scale (medium, large).

```bash
import '@spectrum-web-components/styles/typography.css';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/express/themes.js';
```

And then import the specific components you need to use in your code, such as:

```bash
import '@spectrum-web-components/button/sp-button.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/field-label/sp-field-label.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/textfield/sp-textfield.js';
```

  <InlineAlert slots="text" variant="success"/>

The `import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/express/themes.js';` includes all of the definitions for Express, but you can also only include the specific parts you need. For instance, if you only want to support the light theme and the medium scale, you could specifically include those with:

```bash
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-light.js'; import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/scale-medium.js';
```

For more details on themes and all of the color and scale options, see [this link](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/tools/theme/).

-   Use a `webpack.config.js` for bundling the Spectrum Web Components and your JavaScript into a bundle. If you used the basic javascript template for your add-on, you can copy it in from a sample add-on, such as the SWC one in the contributed samples folder. Also be sure to include the webpack specific dependencies and script options in your `package.json`, which you can also copy from a sample like SWC. If you find that some files aren't being moved to `dist` after you build, you'll want to edit the file (line 31,32) to add more file types to copy.

-   Now you can use the `scale`, `color` and `theme` selections you desire with the `<sp-theme>` component. Within those tags is where you should place all of your content that you want styled with those settings. For example:

```html
<body>
    <sp-theme scale="medium" color="light" theme="express">
        /* Everything you want styled with those settings goes in here */
        <sp-field-label required for="txtName"
            >Enter your full name in the field below</sp-field-label
        >
        <sp-textfield
            multiline
            grows
            id="txtName"
            placeholder="Full Name"
        ></sp-textfield>
        <sp-button>Submit</sp-button>
    </sp-theme>
</body>
```

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="info"/>

Check out the [code samples](../../samples.md) in the contributed folder for **SWC** and **Pix** for examples of using Spectrum Web Components with plain JavaScript and React accordingly.

#### React Spectrum with Express Theme Steps

[The React Spectrum Express theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-spectrum/theme-express) is still in alpha stage currently, but can be used with the following steps:

1.  Install it in your project with:

    `npm install @react-spectrum/theme-express`

2.  Install the express themed icons (optional - if needed):

    `npm install @spectrum-icons/express`

3.  Import the theme and icons into your code to use them. For example, notice the following code snippet which imports and sets the Express `theme`, light `colorScheme` option and medium `scale` option on the `<Provider>` object. It also illustrates how to use the Express version of the `Delete` icon.

```js
import { theme as expressTheme } from "@react-spectrum/theme-express";
import Delete from "@spectrum-icons/express/Delete";

const App = ({ addOnSdk }) => {
    return (
        <Provider theme={expressTheme} colorScheme="light" scale="medium">
            <Button variant="accent">
                <Delete />
            </Button>
        </Provider>
    );
};
```

These screenshots are from a React Spectrum app with the theme and icons changed from the default theme, (first screenshot), to the Express theme (second screenshot), to illustrate some differences for reference. Remember the React Spectrum + Express theme is still in alpha, so not all of the components have been completely ported over yet.

![Default theme](./img/default-theme.png)
![Express theme](./img/express-theme.png)

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="success"/>

Check out the variety of icons available for use in your add-ons as well from [Spectrum here](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/icons/). There's also a set of icons for the Express theme in an alpha stage currently available. To use those, install the package with `npm i @spectrum-icons/express`. Then you can use them by importing them. See the above steps for an example of how to import and use an icon.
