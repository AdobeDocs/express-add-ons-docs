# Introduction

Thank you for joining the community of developers worldwide that are creating add-ons for Adobe Express.

## Guideline Categories

Adobe's goal is to publish high-quality add-ons. With that goal in mind, weâ€™ve created this set of guidelines to give you some tips on best practices, and ensure you take the right steps to get your add-on approved:

- [General guidelines](./general/index.md)
- [Adobe Express Developer Program brand guidelines](./brand-guidelines.md) (aka: "Developer Brand Guidelines" throughout these guides)
- [Monetization guidelines](./monetization.md)
- [Generative AI guidelines](./genai/index.md)
