# Security

Users must be able to access an add-on without compromising their security or negatively affecting their systems.

Use these guidelines to ensure the security of your add-on.

## Malicious code

Your add-on must not include any malicious code, viruses or malware that could harm a userâ€™s system, or compromise their data.

## User information

Your add-on must not transmit any sensitive user information without prior authorization or consent.

## Vulnerabilities

Your add-on must not feature any currently-known security vulnerabilities, such as unsecured communication channels, weak authentication mechanisms, or potential injection attacks.

We expect developers to maintain their add-on after completion and listing. This includes fixing bugs and addressing any security issues. It is also good practice to be responsive to user feedback and requests.

## Secure coding

Your add-on must follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, as well as proper error handling.
