# Overview

This section provides a set of guides to help you in the distribution stage of your add-on.

## Introduction

The general guidelines that can be found in this section cover a variety of areas including [acceptable content](./content.md), [user interface guidelines](./user-interface.md), [listing metadata](./listing.md), [feature functionality](./features.md) and testing guidelines (e.g., [compatibility](./compatibility.md), [usability](./usability.md), [accessibility](./accessibility.md), [performance](./performance.md)) and more.

## Testing

Testing is an important part of the add-on creation process. It ensures that the add-on is free from bugs, works as intended, and performs as smoothly as possible.

We strongly recommend that you test your add-on rigorously before submitting it for review, to avoid rejection or delays in submission
