## Listing metadata

Your listing metadata provides Adobe and users with details about your add-on. Follow the guidelines below to ensure your listing clearly describes everything you want your users to know about your add-on.

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="info"/>

**NOTE:** Please avoid the use of emojis in your listing metadata as the user interface does not allow them.

Refer to our [Developer Brand Guidelines](../brand-guidelines.md) for more information.

### Naming your add-on

Consider using a simple name that is easy to spell, but distinctive enough to find using search.

The name should give users an idea of what the add-on does. For example, using a company name may be clear to you, but not to other users. Try to avoid using a long name where possible.

When listing an add-on, you must not use the word "Premium" to describe your upgrade options, as this should only be used in relation to the [Adobe Express Premium Plan](https://www.adobe.com/express/pricing).

### Your add-on description

Let your users know clearly and concisely what your add-on does.

Think of this as your elevator pitch. Use this space to concisely describe the functionality and benefits of your add-on, using tone and language which is appropriate to your add-on and your own personal or brand style.

If your add-on generates assets via AI or imports assets from an asset repository, you should include accurate and up-to-date information about usage rights here.

Consult our [Generative AI guidelines](../genai/index.md) for more information.

### Your summary

Use the summary section to concisely outline the features and functionality of the add-on. Think of this as the tagline to your add-on.

### Support email

You must provide a valid email address so that we can contact you for support. End users will not see this email address.

### Screenshots

Your screenshots should accurately represent the functionality and appearance of the add-on, such as key features and important user steps. It is essential to refrain from including images that could potentially mislead users or are deemed inappropriate.

### Your icon

Use an original icon that complies with our [Developer Brand Guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf). Consider using a design that illustrates what the add-on does.

Your icon should be simple and distinctive, and must be suitable for viewing on different devices and browsers.

### Help URL

Include a link to a valid webpage that provides accurate and relevant information about the add-on’s usage and functionality.

It is recommended to add support for common queries or user issues.

### Privacy Policy/License Agreement

You must include details of your privacy policy and contractual terms applicable to the use of your add-on(s). Do not include text that violates our [Developer Brand Guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf).

### Keywords

It is recommended to include keywords to categorize your add-on and make it easier to find. Multi-word keywords are allowed (but remember: spaces count toward the overall character limit for keywords).

Try to include keywords which reflect the features and purpose of the add-on, which the user is likely to search for. Spell out keywords in full. You must not include any words that are abusive and/or derogatory.

### Release section

Use this section to include details of any updates, fixes and improvements you have made to the add-on since launch.

These notes must accurately describe the changes made, and be written in such a way that they make sense to the user.

## Publisher profile

Completing your publisher profile can be helpful in making your app look more professional, interesting and trustworthy.

Ensure that all content adheres to our [Developer Brand Guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf).

### Your publisher name

Create a unique name that reflects your personality. It must not contain inappropriate words or phrases.

### Your description

Use your description to explain a little more about you, including any areas you may specialize in.

### Your logo

Your publisher logo must be original. You must not use the Adobe logo, or any product icons or images, without authorization.

### Your website URL

Include a website so that people can find out more about you. This should successfully open your own website. Specifically, according to page 5 of the [Developer Brand Guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/express/embed-sdk/docs/assets/34359598a6bd85d69f1f09839ec43e12/Adobe_Express_Partner_Program_brand_guide.pdf) your "...domain name must not include any Adobe trademark or product name."

For example:

**www.[Your Company name].com/Add-onforExpress**

NOT:

**www.[Your Company name]forAdobeExpress.com**

### Trader details

In accordance with the [European Union Digital Services Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32022R2065) trader requirements, developers who wish to distribute their add-ons in the European Union (EU) must provide additional information in their publisher profile.
