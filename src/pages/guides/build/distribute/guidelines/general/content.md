- Contain or generate adult content (such as sexual content, nudity, gore, intense violence, or strong language).
- Contain or generate hate speech or speech that promotes violence or bullying or cruel behavior to anyone.
- Generate content that promotes, automates, or relates to highly regulated activities (such as financial advice, medical advice or diagnosis, legal advice or documents, contracts).
- Contain or generate code that could be malicious (such as viruses, malware, spyware, etc.).
- Participate in misinformation/disinformation campaigns.
- Violate intellectual property rights, including copyright, of other persons and companies.
