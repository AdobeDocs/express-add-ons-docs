## Choosing your idea

Before you start, do a little research on the marketplace to see what other developers are doing, and where you can make an impact.

For example:

- Does my add-on help users to do their work quicker and more effectively?

- Does it streamline the userâ€™s workflow(s)?

- Does my add-on enable users to be more creative, or make their work look better?

- Are there lots of add-ons already doing the same thing on the marketplace?

## Use of AI

Does your add-on leverage AI to generate content or automate workflows? If so, be sure to check out the [Generative AI requirements](../genai/).
