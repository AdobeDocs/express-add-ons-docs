# Add-on Listing Guide

### Listing Details

Your listing metadata provides Adobe and users with details about the add-on you are currently submitting. See the [add-on version details below](#add-on-version-details) for the metadata that is submitted for each add-on version.

### add-on Version Details

Here you will provide add-on level details for each add-on version submitted.

The information you add in the following tabs will be made public to users via Adobe's Marketplace surfaces once your version is published.

#### General Tab

- add-on package file (see the [section below](#add-on-package))
- If your add-on requires another application
- If your add-on requires a 3rd party service

- Release notes

#### Add-on package

As part of your submission, you will upload your add-on package. Take the following steps to create your add-on package.

1. Compress your add-on files as a **.zip** file

   - Select all files within your add-on's parent folder. On both macOS and Windows you can right-click to compress:

     **macOS**:
     Right-click > Compress items

     **Windows**:
     Right-click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder

     **Note:** You should _not_ compress the add-on's parent folder. Instead, compress the contents of the parent folder. Failure to do so will likely cause a rejection when submitting.
