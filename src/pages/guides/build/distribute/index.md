# Distribution Overview

Congratulations! You've built a great add-on and you're ready to release it to the community.

To publish and share your add-on, it must first go through a review process. By reviewing every add-on, Adobe aims to help you get your add-ons ready for prime time and helps to ensures your users have great experiences with the add-ons they consume. Our goal is to balance providing you with the best possible developer experience during the review process, while also ensuring the approved add-ons offer a great user experience for our mutual customers.

<!-- ## Submission Requirements

### Publisher profile

Your publisher profile contains information about you as a company or developer as a whole. Once you've submitted this information and it has been approved by Adobe, it will be shown for all add-ons and integrations you publish with Adobe.

Your publisher profile includes required details including:

1. Your publisher public name (often company name or, or your own name)

2. Your publisher marketing website (this website shows things you publish with Adobe and should be scoped to you as the publisher, not scoped to any single add-on or integration you submit)

3. A description of you, the publisher

4. Your logo (in `.jpg` or `.png` format with a size of 250x250 px)

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="info"/>

**IMPORTANT:** You must complete and submit your publisher profile in order to submit your first add-on, however this is only a one-time thing (unless you decide you need to update it for your own reasons). **Note:** Any changes to your publisher profile will need to be submitted for approval again.
Frequently changing your publisher profile can confuse users and erode trust. Please be sure you've considered this before changing this information.
