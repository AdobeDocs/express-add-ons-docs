# UX Guidelines for Adobe Express Add-ons

A successful add-on provides a seamless and intuitive User Experience (UX) that blends harmoniously with Adobe Express.

These Guidelines are your roadmap to creating add-ons that align with Adobe's design principles and visual language, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience. Following them will help you build tools that resonate with users and feel like a natural extension of the application.

## Intended audience

This document is intended for developers, designers, and product teams involved in creating Adobe Express add-ons. Whether you're crafting your first add-on or improving an existing one, these guidelines offer valuable insights and best practices to help you align with Adobe's UX standards.

## How to navigate this document

To get the most out of the UX Guidelines, start by familiarizing yourself with the [Design Principles](design_principles.md) section. They provide the foundation for all design decisions and will help you understand the core values that should drive your work.

Next, the [Theming](theming.md) section shows you how to implement the Spectrum for Adobe Express theme, along with customization options and examples. [Visual Elements](./visual_elements.md) is a detailed list of structural and functional components that make up the Adobe Express visual language. It covers everything from typography to grids, navigation, and a variety of UI elements alongside with implementation examples.

[Feedback & Messaging](feedback_and_messaging.md) provides best practices for communicating feedback or alert errors to users.

<!-- The [Mobile UX](mobile_ux.md) section offers guidance on how to format content for mobile devices so that the user experience is consistent across all platforms. -->

Explore the [Branding Guidelines](branding_guidelines.md) to ensure your add-on is legally & visually aligned with Adobe Express. They cover key aspects of branding, as well as best practices for incorporating promotional images for the Adobe Express add-on Marketplace.

Finally, look at the [Resources & References](./resources_and_references.md) for videos and further reading. Refer to the [Changelog](./changelog.md) to stay up-to-date with the latest features and improvements to these guidelines: they are a living document we encourage you to consult regularly, both as a reference and a source of inspiration.
