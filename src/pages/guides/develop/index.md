# Overview

This section provides a set of guides to help you in the development stage of your add-on.

## Introduction

In these guides, you'll find detailed information about [implementing common use cases](../learn/how-to/index.md), [web frameworks, libraries and bundling](../build/advanced-topics/frameworks-libraries-bundling.md), [performance tips](../build/advanced-topics/performance.md), and more.

Begin by watching this short video below which provides an introduction to some of the add-on features and APIs available for use in your add-ons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
