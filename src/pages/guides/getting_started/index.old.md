# Getting Started Overview

This section provides everything you need to know to get started building add-ons for Adobe Express.

## Introduction

At a high level, add-ons refer to any feature distributed independently from the core Adobe Express that a user can enable or install to extend the functionality. Adobe provides some built-in add-ons out of the box, but 3rd party developers also have the opportunity to create and distribute their own add-ons by following the steps provided in this documentation.

### Getting Started Steps

The [Quickstart](quickstart.md) steps you will follow to get started building your first add-on include:

1. [Set up](quickstart.md#prerequisites) your local environment.
1. [Create a new add-on project](quickstart.md#step-1-create-your-add-on-project)
1. [Build and start your add-on](quickstart.md#step-2-build-and-start-your-add-on).
1. Log in to [Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com/new).
1. Enable the [developer mode](quickstart.md#step-3-enable-add-on-development-mode-first-time-only) (one time only).
1. [Load and run your add-on](quickstart.md#step-4-load-and-run-your-add-on) directly in Adobe Express.
1. [Continue developing your add-on](quickstart.md#step-5-edit-your-add-on), seeing your changes immediately appear in, allowing you to iterate quickly.
