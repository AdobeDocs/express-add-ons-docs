## Development Workflow Use Cases

The Code Playground is designed to support the following development workflow use cases:

- **Experiment First**: Test your ideas and API interactions before committing to full add-on development.
- **Learn as You Go**: Master the basics of the Document APIs and [Add-on SDK](../../references/addonsdk/index.md) without complex setup requirements.
- **Prototype Quickly**: Build and test features in minutes instead of hours with instant feedback.
- **Bridge to Production**: Develop core functionality in Playground before moving to a complete project environment.
- **Debug with Ease**: Isolate and fix specific issues by testing API calls outside your production code.

## How to Access Code Playground

### Step 1: Enable Add-on Development Mode

- Click the avatar icon in the top right corner of Adobe Express, then the gear icon to open the "Settings".
- Enable **Add-on Development** if it's not already enabled:

  ![Adobe Express Settings](./img/settings_alt.png)

### Step 2: Open Code Playground

- With any document open, click the **Add-ons** button in the left rail.
- Select the **Your add-ons** tab.
- Toggle on **Code Playground** at the bottom of the panel:

  ![Adobe Express Code Playground Toggle](./img/toggle-playground.png)

- Once enabled, the playground window will open, allowing you to begin coding immediately:

  ![Adobe Express Code Playground Open](./img/playground-open.png)
  
## Choose Your Development Mode

The playground offers two distinct development modes:

- [**Script Mode**](#script-mode): Experiment with the Adobe Express [Document Sandbox](../../references/document-sandbox/index.md). This mode is equivalent to writing code in the `sandbox/code.js` file in an add-on project running locally, but allows you to rapidly test in Express directly.
- [**Add-on Mode**](#add-on-mode): Test and iterate on your [Add-on UI](../../references/addonsdk/) and functionality with no setup required.

<br/>

| Comparison Factor | Script Mode | Add-on Mode |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose**        | Quick document manipulation tests | Complete add-on UI and functionality |
| **Environment**    | Document Sandbox only | Both iframe and Document Sandbox |
| **API Access**     | [Document APIs](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/index.md) | [Document APIs](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/index.md) + [Add-on UI SDK](../../references/addonsdk/index.md) |
| **Global Await**   | Yes | No |
| **Automatic Imports** | Yes | No |
| **UI Components**  | No UI building | Full HTML/CSS/JS interface creation |
| **Best For**       | Testing document operations | Building complete add-ons |

## Script Mode

### When to Use Script Mode

- To learn how the Document APIs work
- To quickly experiment with Document API calls without UI considerations

**Note:** The code you write in this mode is equivalent to the code you would write and use in the `sandbox/code.js` file in an add-on project running locally.

### How to Use Script Mode

1. Select the **Script** button in the top left corner of the playground window.
2. Enter your [Document API](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/index.md) code in the editor. Manipulate the document directly, add shapes or text, change styles, and more using the automatically available [`editor`](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/classes/Editor.md) object.
3. Execute your script by clicking the **Run Code** button in the right corner of the playground window to see changes in the current document.

  ![Code Playground Script Mode](./img/script-mode.png)

4. If you want to use Document APIs that are currently marked experimental, click on the properties icon to open the [Manifest JSON](../../references/manifest/index.md#requirements) editing modal and toggle **experimentalApis**:

  ![Script Mode Manifest Settings](./img/manifest-props-script.png)

5. Head over to our [How-to guides](../develop/how_to.md) to see some examples of using the Document APIs with example code snippets. For instance, the guides:

    - [How to Use Geometry](../develop/how_to/use_geometry.md)
    - [How to Use Color](../develop/how_to/use_color.md)
    - [How to Use Text](../develop/how_to/use_text.md)

#### Key Considerations

- **No UI**: Script mode is focused on Document API interactions and does not support building a user interface. If you want to create a UI, switch to [Add-on mode](#add-on-mode).

- **Global Await**: The script runtime provides a global `async` wrapper, allowing you to use `await` directly when executing asynchronous code, without needing to wrap it in an `async` function. This is particularly useful for API calls that return promises, where an `await` is needed to pause the execution of an `async` function until the Promise is resolved or rejected. For example, loading a font is an asynchronous operation, but in Script mode you can use `await` directly to pause the execution of the script until the font is loaded, ie:

```js
// The script runtime provides an async wrapper to allow this:
const textNode = editor.context.selection[0];
const lato = await fonts.fromPostscriptName("Lato-Light");
```

In contrast, in [**Add-on mode**](#add-on-mode) you will need to manually wrap the code in an `async` function and use `await` in it, ie:

```js
//sandbox.code.js or Document JS tab
loadFont: async () => {
  const textNode = editor.context.selection[0];
  const lato = await fonts.fromPostscriptName("Lato-Light");  
}
```

- **Automatic Imports**: Script mode automatically imports the `express-document-sdk` modules, so you don't need to add import statements for the [Document APIs](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/index.md). However, if you do add import statements, it wont harm anything.

<InlineAlert slots="text" variant="info"/>

Once you switch to the [Add-on mode](#add-on-mode) or to your local add-on development environment, you will need to make sure to handle your `async` functions and `import` statements manually.

## Add-on Mode

### When to Use Add-on Mode

- To develop and test an add-on directly in Adobe Express, without having to set up a full development environment.
- To prototype an add-on before building a full project.
- To iterate quickly on your add-on's UI and logic.

### How to Use Add-on Mode

1. Click on the **Add-on** button (next to the **Script** button in the top left corner of the playground window).
2. Write code for your add-on in each of the supplied tabs (described below). This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that will run in the iframe UI or in the Document Sandbox to interact directly with the Express document (optionally).
3. Click **Run Code** to execute your add-on. Your add-on should open in an iframe on the right side of the Adobe Express window, ie:

  ![Code Playground Add-on Mode](./img/addon-mode.png)

4. If you need to set [manifest properties](../../references/manifest/index.md) for your add-on (ie: if you want to use APIs that are currently marked experimental, set permissions, OAuth domains etc), click on the properties icon to open the Manifest JSON editing modal:

  ![Add-on Mode Manifest Settings](./img/manifest-props-addon.png)

### Add-on Mode Tabs

The Add-on mode features four tabs for organizing your code:

1. **HTML Tab**

  This tab is for writing HTML code that defines the structure of your add-on's user interface. You can create elements like buttons, text fields, and layout containers here. Functionally, this tab mirrors the role of the `index.html` file you'd use in a typical add-on project.

2. **CSS Tab**

  Style your add-on's HTML elements in this tab. Create a visually appealing interface consistent with Adobe Express design patterns. This section corresponds to the `styles.css` file in a standard add-on project.

3. **Iframe JS Tab**

  This tab is for writing JavaScript code that runs in the iframe context of your add-on. Here, you can interact with:

  - The [Add-on UI SDK (`addOnUISdk`)](../../references/addonsdk/index.md)
  - The DOM elements in your HTML
  - Event handlers for your UI components

  This environment corresponds to the code you would typically write in your `index.js` or UI JavaScript files in a full add-on project.

4. **Document JS Tab**

  This tab is where you write JavaScript code that interacts directly with the Adobe Express document. It runs in the [Document Sandbox](../../references/document-sandbox/index.md) environment and gives you access to:

  - Document manipulation capabilities with the [Document APIs](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/index.md)
  - [Communication APIs](../../references/document-sandbox/communication/index.md) to facilitate interaction between the iframe context and the Document Sandbox.

  The Document JS tab corresponds to the code typically found in the `code.js` file of a complete add-on project.

## Transitioning from Script Mode to Add-on Mode

Once you've tested your code in Script mode, you can easily transition it into the [Add-on mode](#add-on-mode) to build a user interface around your new functionality. Here's how:

1. Use the **Copy** button in the right corner to quickly copy your code to the clipboard.
2. Click the **Add-on** button to enter [Add-on mode](#add-on-mode).
3. Paste the code into the [**Document JS**](#add-on-mode-tabs) tab. **Note:** Don't forget you'll need to add the `import` statements for the Document APIs and handle your `async` functions manually in this mode.
4. Modify your script code to be used in the add-on context along with your front-end logic in the [**HTML**](#add-on-mode-tabs), [**Iframe JS**](#add-on-mode-tabs), and [**CSS**](#add-on-mode-tabs) tabs. Use the initial sample code provided as a reference.
5. If you set any manifest properties (ie: **experimentalApis**) while in [Script mode](#how-to-use-script-mode), make sure to set the same in the [Add-ons mode - Edit Manifest JSON Modal](#how-to-use-add-on-mode) as well. These settings only apply to the context of the development mode you're in.
6. Click the **Run Code** button to execute your code within the context of your add-on.
