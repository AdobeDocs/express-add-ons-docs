If you feel comfortable with the basics of add-on development, let's take you to the next level!

## 1. Discover our UX Guidelines and Spectrum Web Components

Adobe Express is based on the [Adobe Spectrum design system](https://s2.spectrum.adobe.com/), and your add-ons should follow the same design language.

<br/><br/>

</div>

We've created a set of [UX Guidelines](../../resources/design/index.md) to help you get started; they cover the [design principles](../../resources/design/ux_guidelines/design_principles.md), [color](../../resources/design/ux_guidelines/visual_elements.md#color), [typography](../../resources/design/ux_guidelines/visual_elements.md#typography), [layout](../../resources/design/ux_guidelines/visual_elements.md#layout--structure) and much more.

You should use [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/), a library of pre-built components that you can use to create a consistent UI for your add-on. You can test them in a sandboxed environment like Codepen

[![Spectrum Web Components Codepen](../../resources/tutorials/images/bingo-codepen.png)](../../resources/tutorials/spectrum-workshop/index.md#quickstart-try-spectrum-web-components)

Read our [Implementation Guide](../../resources/design/implementation_guide.md) or follow our two-part[Bingo Card Generator add-on tutorial](../../resources/tutorials/spectrum-workshop/index.md), which covers both basic JavaScript and React.

## 2. Master the Document Sandbox API

To become an expert add-on developer, you must confidently orient yourself around the Document API. New features are constantly being added, and it's paramount to learn how to read and decode the SDK Reference to know how to use them.

Finish reading the [Adobe Express Document API Concepts](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/concepts/index.md) guide to learn about Object Oriented Programming concepts and the various [Classes and Interfaces](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/concepts/index.md#classes-and-interfaces) available to you.

Complete the [Dimension annotation sample add-on exercise](../../references/document-sandbox/document-apis/concepts/index.md#from-theory-to-practice) to practice your new knowledge.

## 3. Distribute your add-on to the Marketplace

Add-ons can be [privately distributed](../../guides/build/distribute/private-dist.md) for testing purposes or [published in the Adobe Express Marketplace](../../guides/build/distribute/public-dist.md).

[![Publish your add-on](../../guides/build/distribute/img/public-listing-submission-v2.png)](../../guides/build/distribute/public-dist.md)

Familiarize yourself with the details of our [Review Process](../../guides/build/distribute/review_process/index.md) and follow the [Submission Guidelines](../../guides/build/distribute/guidelines/index.md) to prepare your add-on for review.

## 4. Improve your sales with the Monetization Guide

As we mentioned in the [Beginner Path](./beginner.md), add-ons can be monetized according to a variety of models (perpetual, subscription, freemium, credit-based, etc.) and Adobe does not take any commission on the sales.

If you want to learn more about it, please read the [Monetization Guidelines](../../guides/build/distribute/guidelines/monetization.md), or watch the [Marketing and monetizing Adobe Express add-ons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF6FU_d6QoY) video below, recorded at one of the monthly [Adobe Express Office Hours](https://developer.adobe.com/developers-live) community events.

## Next steps

Congratulations üéâ Pause for a moment and pat yourself on the back‚Äîyou've just completed the Advanced Path!

Now that you've learned more than most developers, we have just a few more tasks for you.

- Read about [Advanced topics](../../resources/advanced-topics/frameworks-libraries-bundling.md) like frameworks, bundling, CORS, performance tips, and more.
- Give back to the community! Either engaging with other developers, participating in the [Adobe Express Office Hours](https://developer.adobe.com/developers-live) or contributing to the [Code Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/express-add-on-samples) GitHub repository.
- Let us know what you think of the Documentation! We're always looking to improve it, so if you have any feedback, please [get in touch](http://discord.gg/nc3QDyFeb4).
- Have fun building! -->
