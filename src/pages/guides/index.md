## Skill Level-Based Learning Paths

We've done our best to write this add-on developers documentation as a linear and coherent guide that everyone can find accessible; however, we understand that different users may have different backgrounds. We've created three skill level-based learning paths, designed to address your needs at different stages of your add-on development journey.

- [Beginner Path](./learning-paths/beginner.md)
- [Intermediate Path](./learning-paths/intermediate.md)
- [Advanced Path](./learning-paths/advanced.md)

In each one of them, we've handpicked a selection of resources in a curated order that we believe will be most useful for you.
