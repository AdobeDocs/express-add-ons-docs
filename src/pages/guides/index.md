## Add-ons

Add-ons extend the functionality of [Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com/), unlocking creative workflows for Adobe Express users. The add-ons marketplace is a dedicated platform for developers to distribute and users to discover new add-ons. Check out this quick introduction to Adobe Express add-ons to learn more, then read on to get started. <br/><br/>

### Use Cases

Ready to build your own? Check out these popular use cases supported by our add-on SDK for inspiration:

- Importing images and video
- Exporting renditions of images in different formats
- Connecting to external sources via OAuth 2.0
- Storing and retrieving data
- Drag-and-drop support of content to the canvas
- Retrieving manifest data
- Managing language and locale
- Retrieving the current theme and detecting theme changes

See the [implementing common use cases](develop) page and [code samples](../samples.md) for more details on how to implement the features above.

## Add-on Developer Journey

The journey to developing an add-on is outlined below:

1. Create an add-on project with the CLI. You can refer to the [Getting Started](./getting_started/) guides to help you create your first project quickly.
2. Design your UI using [Adobe's Spectrum Design System](https://spectrum.adobe.com/). This system provides guidelines and resources for designing user interfaces that follow Adobe's design language and best practices.
3. Use the [common use case implementations](./develop/), [code samples](../samples.md), and [references](../references/) to learn how to include all of the features you want to showcase in your add-on. This can help you save time and avoid common mistakes when developing your add-on.
4. [Debug and test](./debug/) your add-on using your favorite browser tools, Visual Studio Code, and the add-on logging window provided in the Adobe Express UI development environment. This will help you identify and fix any bugs or issues before distributing your add-on.
5. Distribute your add-on for public or private sharing. You can refer to the [add-on distribution guidelines](./distribute/) to learn how to package and distribute your add-on on the Adobe add-ons marketplace or privately to your clients.

If you run into any issues at any time throughout your development process, please refer to the [Debug Guides](../guides/debug/) and [FAQ](../guides/faq.md) for more help.
