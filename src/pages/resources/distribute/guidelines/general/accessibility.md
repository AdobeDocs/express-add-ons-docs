For more information, check [Adobe’s Accessibility guidelines](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility.html).

## Accessibility standards

Your add-on should meet accessibility guidelines to ensure it can be used by people with disabilities. This could be [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) or higher.

## Keyboard accessibility

Your add-on’s user interface should provide proper mouse and keyboard focus indicators, and allow for easy navigation and interaction using only a keyboard.

## Alt-text

Your add-on should provide alternative text for images and labels for form fields, as well as other accessibility features which assist users with visual impairments and other disabilities.

## Contrast and fonts

Your colors, contrast and fonts should be easily readable by users with visual impairments, and meet accessibility standards.

## Readability

Your text and commands should be simple and understandable. This is useful for users with dyslexia, as well as those who do not speak English as a first language, and those who are performing actions while multitasking, distracted or under pressure.
