At a high level, add-ons refer to any feature distributed independently from the core product that a user can enable or install to extend the capabilities of the core product. Typically, add-ons will be created by 3rd party developers, however, there will also be scenarios where Adobe will be creating and distributing our own add-ons. Some examples of add-on use cases include; importing media from another source via OAuth 2.0, persisting data (like preferences) to client storage, drag and drop capabilities, and many more. This guide will provide you with all of the information you need to get set up and well on your way to developing your own add-on for Adobe Express.
