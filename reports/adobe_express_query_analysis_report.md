## ü§ñ AI Misinformation Patterns

### Incorrect Imports Being Provided by AI
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG - AI commonly suggests these
@adobe/ccweb-add-on-sdk
import { runtime } from '@adobe/ccweb-add-on-sdk'
import addOnSdkAPI from '@adobe/ccweb-add-on-sdk'
```

### Non-Existent Methods AI Suggests
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG - These methods don't exist
editor.createPage()
editor.document.pages.append()
runtime.call()
runtime.exposeApi()  // Note: This may actually exist in Communication API
textNode.setSize()
element.setTransform()
```

### Correct Alternatives
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT alternatives
// Page creation
editor.documentRoot.pages.addPage(inputGeometry)

// Text creation
editor.createText() + textNode.fullContent.applyCharacterStyles()

// Element append
editor.context.insertionParent.children.append()

// Element sizing
element.width = value; 
element.height = value;
```
