## Validating Ideas 

"Give me ideas for new add-ons that are not already done but could be very useful." 

"Give me add-on ideas that can take advantage of the metadata API." 

## Code Generation 

"Write code to clear all rectangles." 

"Create a function that creates a text node and writes in it." 

"Make me an Adobe add-on that takes in a prompt and creates an image using Gemini 2.0 Flash." 

"Create a function that creates a landscape PNG on the right side of a 1920x1080 screen given a URL." 

"Create a helper function that finds pixel boundaries of an object and returns a PNG rendition." 

"Create add-on UI for ....” 

## Information Search 

"How do I add a textbox programmatically through code to the Adobe Express canvas?" 

"What is the hierarchy for a single image on a single page project?" 

"How can I access the current user using my add-on?" 

"How do I add a video to the document?" 

“Can I mask an image?” 

"What is const textNode = editor.createText();?" 

## Troubleshooting 

"Why does this code only work to draw rectangles over shapes and images, not text?" 

"I got this when I ran it: Unhandled Promise Rejection: ReferenceError: 'colorUtils' is not defined." 

"My add-on in Adobe Express says this when I try to output something: sandboxApi not found." 

"Error: No property with name documentRoot found on Live Object." 

"Error: Experimental APIs are not supported. To try them in your local add-on - set 'experimentalApis: true' in 'manifest.json'."
