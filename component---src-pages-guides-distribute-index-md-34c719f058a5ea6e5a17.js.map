Once you've submitted this information and it has been approved by Adobe, it will be shown for all add-ons and integrations you publish with Adobe.\n     Your publisher profile includes required details including:\n     1. Your publisher public name (often company name or, or your own name)\n     2. Your publisher marketing website (this website shows things you publish with Adobe and should be scoped to you as the publisher, not scoped to any single add-on or integration you submit)\n     3. A description of you, the publisher\n     4. Your logo (in `.jpg` or `.png` format with a size of 250x250 px)\n     <InlineAlert slots=\"text\" variant=\"info\"/>\n     **IMPORTANT:** You must complete and submit your publisher profile in order to submit your first add-on, however this is only a one-time thing (unless you decide you need to update it for your own reasons). **Note:** Any changes to your publisher profile will need to be submitted for approval again.\n     Frequently changing your publisher profile can confuse users and erode trust.
